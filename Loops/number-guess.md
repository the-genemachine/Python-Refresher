The selected Python code is a simple number guessing game. The player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game ends when the player either guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.

The script starts by importing the `os` and `random` modules. The `os` module is used to clear the console screen, and the `random` module is used to generate a random number.

The `clear_screen()` function is defined to clear the console screen. It uses the `os.system()` function to execute a command in the system shell. The command executed depends on the name of the operating system.

```python
def clear_screen():
    os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
```

The `display_title(title)` function is defined to display a title on the console screen. It first calls the `clear_screen()` function to clear the console, then prints the title surrounded by equal signs.

```python
def display_title(title):
    clear_screen()
    print("=" * len(title))
    print(title)
    print("=" * len(title))
    print()
```

The `generate_random_number(start, end)` function generates a random number within a specified range. It uses the `random.randint()` function to generate and return a random integer between the `start` and `end` arguments.

```python
def generate_random_number(start, end):
    return random.randint(start, end)
```

The `guessing_game()` function is the main function of the game. It first displays the title of the game, then generates a secret number between 1 and 100. It sets the maximum number of attempts to 5 and initializes the number of attempts made to 0. It then enters a loop where it prompts the player to enter a guess, checks the guess against the secret number, and provides feedback. If the guess is correct, it congratulates the player and breaks the loop. If the guess is incorrect, it informs the player whether the guess was too high or too low and continues the loop. If the player runs out of attempts, it informs the player and reveals the secret number.

```python
def guessing_game():
    ...
```

Finally, the script checks if it is being run as a standalone program (as opposed to being imported as a module). If it is, it calls the `guessing_game()` function to start the game.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    guessing_game()
```

This code is a simple but functional number guessing game. It demonstrates basic Python concepts such as function definition, user input, conditional statements, random number generation, and the use of the `if __name__ == "__main__":` idiom to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported.
