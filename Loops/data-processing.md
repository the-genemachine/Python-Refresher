The provided Python script is designed to process numerical data from a file, calculate basic statistics (total, average, maximum, and minimum), and display these statistics to the user. It is structured into several functions, each with a specific role, enhancing the code's readability and modularity.

The script begins by importing the `os` module, which is used in the `clear_screen()` function to clear the console screen. This function checks the operating system's name (`os.name`) to determine the appropriate command (`cls` for Windows, `clear` for Unix/Linux) to clear the screen.

```python
def clear_screen():
    os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
```

Next, the `display_title(title)` function is defined to display a title on the console. It first clears the screen using `clear_screen()` and then prints the title, surrounded by equal signs for emphasis. This function is used to make the output more user-friendly and organized.

```python
def display_title(title):
    clear_screen()
    print("=" * len(title))
    print(title)
    print("=" * len(title))
    print()
```

The core functionality of the script is encapsulated in the `process_data(filename)` function. This function reads numerical data from a specified file, calculates the total, average, maximum, and minimum values of the data, and then prints these statistics. It opens the file using a `with` statement, ensuring the file is properly closed after its contents are read. The data is read line by line, converted to integers, and stored in a list. The `sum()`, `max()`, and `min()` functions are used to compute the statistics, which are then displayed.

```python
def process_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        data = [int(line.strip()) for line in data]
    total = sum(data)
    average = total / len(data)
    maximum = max(data)
    minimum = min(data)
    print("Total:", total)
    print("Average:", average)
    print("Maximum:", maximum)
    print("Minimum:", minimum)
```

Finally, the `main()` function serves as the entry point of the program. It sets a title for the operation, displays it using `display_title(title)`, and calls `process_data(filename)` with a specified filename to process the data. This structured approach allows for easy modification, such as changing the filename or adding additional functionality.

```python
def main():
    title = "Data Processing from File"
    display_title(title)
    filename = "data.txt"
    process_data(filename)
```

The script concludes with a conditional statement that checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module). If true, it calls the `main()` function, initiating the program's execution.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python script demonstrates a practical application of reading from files, processing data, and utilizing functions to organize code logically. It showcases basic file handling, data manipulation, and the use of conditional statements and loops in Python.
