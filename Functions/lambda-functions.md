The provided Python script demonstrates the use of lambda functions to perform basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Lambda functions are anonymous functions defined with the `lambda` keyword. They can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. This script utilizes lambda functions for quick and concise mathematical calculations.

Initially, the script imports the `os` module, which is used to clear the console screen. This is achieved through the `clear_screen` function, enhancing user experience by providing a clean slate before displaying the program's title and options.

```python
def clear_screen():
    os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
```

The `display_title` function prints the program's title in a formatted manner. It calls `clear_screen` to ensure the title is the first thing the user sees on the console.

```python
def display_title(title):
    clear_screen()
    print("=" * len(title))
    print(title)
    print("=" * len(title))
    print()
```

Lambda functions for the four basic mathematical operations are defined succinctly. Each lambda function takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, representing the operands. The division operation includes a conditional expression to handle division by zero, returning a specific message in such cases.

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
subtract = lambda x, y: x - y
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y
divide = lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else "Cannot divide by zero"
```

The `main` function orchestrates the program's flow. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operation. Based on the user's choice, the corresponding lambda function is called, and the result is displayed. The program handles invalid choices by displaying an appropriate message.

```python
if choice == '1':
    result = add(num1, num2)
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```

This script exemplifies the use of lambda functions for simple, inline operations, and demonstrates basic user input handling and conditional logic in Python. It's a straightforward example of how to create a minimalistic calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
