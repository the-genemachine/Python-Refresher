The provided Python script is designed as a student record management system, leveraging a dictionary to store and manipulate student records. This system allows for adding new student records, removing existing ones, and displaying all records. Each student's information, including their name and grades, is stored as a dictionary value, keyed by a unique student ID. The script is structured into functions for clear screen, title display, and student record operations, alongside a main function that implements a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

The `clear_screen()` function uses the `os.system()` call to clear the console, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems by checking `os.name` and executing the appropriate command (`cls` for Windows, `clear` for Unix/Linux systems).

```python
def clear_screen():
    os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
```

The `display_title(title)` function enhances user experience by displaying a clear and formatted title on the console. It calls `clear_screen()` before printing the title, surrounded by equal signs for emphasis.

```python
def display_title(title):
    clear_screen()
    print("=" * len(title))
    print(title)
    print("=" * len(title))
    print()
```

For managing student records, three key functions are defined: `add_student()`, `remove_student()`, and `display_students()`. The `add_student()` function updates the `records` dictionary by adding a new entry with the student ID as the key and a dictionary containing the student's name and grades as the value.

```python
def add_student(records, student_id, name, grades):
    records[student_id] = {"name": name, "grades": grades}
```

The `remove_student()` function checks if the specified student ID exists within the records and, if found, removes the entry, providing feedback on the action taken.

```python
def remove_student(records, student_id):
    if student_id in records:
        del records[student_id]
```

The `display_students()` function iterates over the `records` dictionary, printing each student's ID, name, and grades, ensuring all stored records are easily viewable.

```python
def display_students(records):
    for student_id, info in records.items():
        print(f"ID: {student_id}, Name: {info['name']}, Grades: {info['grades']}")
```

The `main()` function orchestrates the program's flow, presenting a menu with options to add, remove, or display student records, or exit the program. User choices are handled through conditional statements, directing to the appropriate function based on the input.

```python
def main():
    while True:
        choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")
        # Conditional statements to handle user choices
```

This script demonstrates a practical application of dictionaries for data management, function-based organization for code clarity, and user interaction through a simple console-based menu. It showcases fundamental Python programming concepts such as dictionaries, loops, conditional statements, and basic input/output operations.
