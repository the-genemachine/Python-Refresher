The provided Python script is a simple language translator that translates English text to French using a predefined dictionary. The script is structured into several functions, each designed to perform a specific task, enhancing the code's readability and modularity.

The script starts with importing the `os` module, which is utilized in the `clear_screen()` function to clear the console screen. This function checks the operating system's name to determine the appropriate command to clear the screen, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems.

```python
def clear_screen():
    os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
```

Following this, the `display_title(title)` function is defined to display a title on the console. It employs the `clear_screen()` function to ensure the console is clear before printing the title, which is surrounded by equal signs for emphasis. This function is used to make the output more user-friendly and organized.

```python
def display_title(title):
    clear_screen()
    print("=" * len(title))
    print(title)
    print("=" * len(title))
    print()
```

The core functionality of the script is encapsulated in the `translate(text, dictionary)` function. This function takes a string of text and a dictionary as arguments. It splits the input text into words, looks up each word in the provided dictionary, and joins them back together to form the translated text. If a word is not found in the dictionary, it is left unchanged. This approach allows for a simple yet effective translation mechanism.

```python
def translate(text, dictionary):
    words = text.split()
    translated_text = " ".join(dictionary.get(word, word) for word in words)
    return translated_text
```

The `main()` function serves as the entry point of the program. It sets a title for the operation, displays it using `display_title(title)`, and initializes an English to French dictionary. It then prompts the user to input text to translate, calls the `translate(text, dictionary)` function with the user's input and the dictionary, and finally displays the translated text. This structured approach allows for easy modification, such as changing the target language or adding additional functionality.

```python
def main():
    title = "Language Translator"
    display_title(title)
    # English to French dictionary initialization and translation process
```

The script concludes with a conditional statement that checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module). If true, it calls the `main()` function, initiating the program's execution.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python script demonstrates a practical application of dictionaries for language translation, showcasing basic file handling, data manipulation, and the use of functions to organize code logically. It highlights the power of Python's data structures and string manipulation capabilities in creating useful applications.
